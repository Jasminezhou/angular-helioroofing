</p>Synthetic slate is considered a premium roofing product, compared to standard asphalt shingles. Many synthetic slate roofing products are guaranteed to last at least from 30 to 50 years. These low maintenance roofing tiles are designed to withstand high wind, fire, freeze-thaw cycles, and other conditions. Some roofing tiles also contain fire retardant and UV inhibitors for extra protection.</p> <ul> <li>Synthetic slate is considered a "green" building alternative—even those that use virgin materials—because all types of synthetic slate can be recycled at the end of a roof's usable life.</li> <li>Synthetic slate shingles are more durable than authentic slate, as they contain advanced ultraviolet inhibitors to reduce wear from the sun.</li> <li>Safety is built-in. Synthetic slate typically contains impact modifiers to help withstand storm damage; in fact, most are certified by Underwriters Laboratories for Class 4 impact resistance, the highest level for roofing materials. Many synthetic slates also have the highest fire-resistance rating—Class A—which means they're effective against severe exposure to external fires, are not readily flammable and do not spread fire.</li> <li>Transportation and installation of synthetic slate shingles is easier and less expensive than other roofing materials. Synthetic slate shingles are lighter than all asphalt shingles and, at 1.25 pounds per tile, are only a quarter the weight of authentic slate shingles. Their light weight also means that a standard roof structure can support synthetic slate shingles with no special reinforcement, making them practical for mainstream residential construction. During installation, synthetic slate shingles can easily be field- cut with a utility knife and nailed into place with standard roofing nails and a pneumatic nail gun. These characteristics are in sharp contrast with those of authentic slate installation, which requires precision cutting and nailing of heavy shingles that chip and crack easily.<li> </ul>
