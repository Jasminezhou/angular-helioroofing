<p>EPDM single-ply membranes have been the commercial roofing industry’s material of choice for nearly half a century. Today, we offer the most high-performance, energy-efficient, sustainable and innovative line of EPDM membranes and accessories on the market. From Factory-Applied Tape for stronger, more dependable seams to the industry’s only ENERGY-STAR®-qualified EPDM membrane. So when you need a sustainable, long-lasting rooftop, look no further than the single-ply membrane with nearly a half-century track record of performance and durability --> EPDM.</p>
</br>
<p>Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) is the fastest-growing segment of the commercial roofing industry, and we are able to offer this type of roofing material. TPO white and tan membranes are ENERGY STAR®-qualified and Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC)-certified, and have been directly attributed to a reduction in energy use and cooling costs for buildings in warm climates. </p>

<h4>Benefits</h4> 
<h5>COST EFFECTIVE</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Application techniques offer fast track installation on every project specified, creating real value by reducing site labour time. Additionally the rapid installation programme often permits early fit-out below, keeping work to programme and reducing the time to completion and hand-over.</li>
	<li>The lightweight system allows for other building materials and structural steel to be reduced at the building’s conceptual stage.</li>
	<li>Single ply is ideal for new build or refurbishment projects.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<h5>DURABLE</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Hot air welding for the seams provides a strong and reliable bond that is well recognised in the single ply roofing industry. The fused overlapping membrane sheets provide a homogenous layer and total waterproofing security.<li>
	<li>With high tensile strength in excess of 1200N for Thermoplan and 1100N for Thermofol, the closed fibre pre-coated polyester cross-weave reinforces the membranes and makes them resistant to tears and punctures.<li>
	<li>The membranes have been developed to withstand climatic extremes and temperature shocks.<li>
</ul>
</br>
<h5>CHEMICALLY RESISTANT</h5>
<ul>
	</li>Our use of high quality polymers and constituents in the formula ensures the membranes remain flexible to at least -30 degrees centigrade.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h5>FLAME-FREE INSTALLATION</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The seams are thermally welded with hot air replacing traditional torching methods, bringing its installation in line with the outlook for safety conscious practice.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h5>RESISTANT TO NATURAL ELEMENTS</h5>
<ul>	
	<li>The integrated woven lattice reinforcements within the membrane, together with the high performance fastening system and strong homogenous welded seams combine to eliminate the risk of wind uplift failure.</li>
	<li>The reflective pearl white finish of the Thermoplan pearl-white membrane reduces solar gain, minimising thermal and structural movement in the construction.</li>
	<li>The FPO and PVC formulations ensure full resistance to micro-organism attack which is vital to their success in ballasted or green roof situations.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h5>FIRE RESISTANCE</h5>
<ul> 
	<li>To provide maximum fire resistance, our formulation includes a high performance halogen-free fire retardant which means the membrane carries a FAB fire rating.</li>
	<li>Our choice of fire retardant reduces the volume of product required allowing for a greater percentage of active polymer in the formulation.</li>
</ul>

<h5>ENVIRONMENTAL CREDENTIALS</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Thermoplan T contains no heavy metals, halogens or plasticisers.</li>
	<li>Thermoplan T has one of the lowest production embodied energy values.</li>
	<li>The reflectivity of Thermoplan T reduces solar gain and contributes to energy conservation within the building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>PRACTICAL SUSTAINABILITY</h5>
<ul> 
	<li>Thermoplan T is 100% recyclable and can be reprocessed at our manufacturing plant.</li>
	<li>PVC membranes can be recycled and converted in to other components such as protective or separation layers for roofs.</li>
	<li>Putting an extensive green roof on top of a single ply system provides an area of natural habitat for plants and small wildlife.	</li>
	<li>An extensive green roof will protect the waterproofing membrane from climatic extremes, ultra-violet light and mechanical damage, significantly increasing the life expectancy of the system.</li>
	<li>With an extensive green roof, all the additional environmental benefits are gained including reduction in rain water run-off which humidifies the air helping to reduce the ‘heat island’ effect.</li>
	<li>An extensive green roof, ballasted or paved finish will considerably reduce sound from both inside and outside the building.</li>
